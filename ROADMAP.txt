Step 1: Drone (done):
You have per neighborhood:
    eulerized_graph.pkl ← full road network (Eulerized)
    eulerian_path.json ← drone's flight path
    snow_map.csv ← simulated snow-covered edges
    .png maps with and without snow
    - parcourir toute la ville avec le drone et detecter les chemins enneiges


Step 2: Vehicle:
    1: Design an agent (decision making):
        -> Sees all neighbors (where can I go ?)
        -> Decides direction (where should I go ? Did I see the road recently ? Is it snowy ?)
        -> memory management (handling a heap of recent seen vehicles)
        -> Contains parameters (greed ? Random ? Prioritize snow or unseen ? Memory size)
        -> Different types (cheap vs fast vs smart) & measure tradeoffs (does more memory always help ?)

== The reports ==
you’ll find in, say, resources/neighborhoods/anjou/:
    vehicle_stats.json – raw JSON of fuel, steps, snow cleared, returns
    vehicle_report.txt – the human-readable summary you asked for
    vehicle_path.json – full detailed path log
    vehicle_cleared.csv – list of cleared edges

    2: Snow clearing simulation (running the experiment)
        -> Initializes the graph and loads the map with settings (number of vehicles, fuel per vehicle, max load, memory size, etc)
        -> Place a vehicle (or several ?) on a starting node, and start a loop:
            - decide next move
            - move position
            - mark cleared
            - record full path
            - Record resource usage
        -> Outputs the cleared paths and the stats (costs, etc)
        -> Graphical output overlay of the cleared paths: city eulerian graph + base snow + removed snow (don't add another layer of paint everytime, ask GPT to draw first the removed snow, then the snow,then eulerian otherwise the layers will add up into weird colors)

    SCENARIO:
    - pas assez de vehicle ? Qu'est ce qu'on fait
    - assez de deneigeuse: focus sur finir plus vite 
    - sous chemins euleriens
    - essence
    - memoire ?
