Step 1: Drone (done):
You have per neighborhood:
    eulerized_graph.pkl ← full road network (Eulerized)
    eulerian_path.json ← drone's flight path
    snow_map.csv ← simulated snow-covered edges


Step 2: Vehicle:
Once the drone has identified roads requiring plowing, you will:

    Extract the subgraph of those roads.

    Possibly need new eulerization or Chinese Postman-like algorithms on those subgraphs.

    Factor in vehicle constraints (one-way roads, plow efficiency, vehicle type costs, etc.)
