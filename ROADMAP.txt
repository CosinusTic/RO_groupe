Step 1: Drone
✔️ Completes the drone phase by computing a minimal Eulerian traversal path of the entire network.

✔️ Can be used to generate cost estimates for drone operation (via distance + per-km cost).

✔️ Should be stored and reused in the vol_drone/ subdirectory as per deliverables.

Step 2: Vehicle:
Once the drone has identified roads requiring plowing, you will:

    Extract the subgraph of those roads.

    Possibly need new eulerization or Chinese Postman-like algorithms on those subgraphs.

    Factor in vehicle constraints (one-way roads, plow efficiency, vehicle type costs, etc.)
